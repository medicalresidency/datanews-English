                    <br>
                    <br>Upon reading yet another report of a medical trainee’s suicide on her phone, <span
                        class="people-Bing people"></span> Bingbing, </span>a former trainee who voluntarily left her
                    program, could only muster this thought.
                    <br>
                    <br>At that time,<span class="people-Bing people">Bingbing</span> had just received her preliminary
                    results for her second attempt at the graduate school entrance exam and was preparing for the
                    upcoming interviews. Although her scores weren’t ideal, and she faced the possibility of
                    transferring to a different program, Bingbing felt relieved about her decision to leave the
                    residency program and pursue further studies. It was a chance to return to campus life. She hoped
                    that after graduation, she might find a teaching position at a university and finally enjoy a
                    regular workweek with weekends off.
                    <br>
                    <br>While the public was shocked by the occurrence of four trainee suicides in just one month, <span
                        class="people-Bing people">Bingbing </span>found it unsurprising. She had considered quitting
                    within the first three months of her training—and had even contemplated suicide at one point. After
                    two grueling years, she finally decided to end her suffering and leave the program.
                    <br>
                    <br>In China,
                    <span>medical students must complete five years of undergraduate education, followed by three years
                        of standardized residency training and an additional two to four years of specialized training
                        before they can officially become specialists. This system, known as “standardized residency
                        training” (commonly abbreviated as “residency”),</span> is an unavoidable step for medical
                    students on their journey to becoming licensed doctors.
                    <br>
                    <br>Each department rotation in the residency program lasts three months. For many trainees, the
                    first rotation is often the most shocking and overwhelming experience. Research tracking the mental
                    health of medical trainees revealed that
                    <span>
                        at the beginning of residency, 9.1% of Chinese trainees met the diagnostic criteria for
                        depression. After three months, this figure surged to 21.1%, before the rate of increase slowed.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        Overall, 35.1% of participants exhibited signs of severe depression within their first year of
                        residency.

                    Since the residency system was formally launched in 2014, China has established over 1,100
                    national-level training centers and more than 11,000 specialized training bases, enrolling a total
                    of 1.07 million trainees. Within the vast ocean of tertiary hospitals, some trainees have
                    successfully obtained their certifications and secured jobs, while others have chosen to exit and
                    explore alternative career paths. Tragically, some remain forever trapped in this system.
                    <span>A decade
                        has passed since the inception of the residency program. How much of its original vision remains

                It can be said that, whether in terms of self-expectation or societal evaluation, most medical students
                and doctors strive to embody the image of “angels in white” who save lives and heal the wounded.
                <br>
                <br> So why would hands trained to save lives turn against themselves?
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="people-Zhu people">Zhu Jingping</span>, a specialized master’s medical trainee in the
                obstetrics and gynecology department of a hospital in Guangxi, was nearing the completion of his
                three-year residency. From his own experience, there is a stark hierarchy within the medical profession.
                <span>If one were to visualize the power structure of a hospital as a pyramid, trainees like Zhu are not
                    only at the base of the pyramid but also at its very fringes. </span>For trainees stepping out of
                the ivory tower, this reality is often brutal.
                <br>
                <br> The first time <span class="people-Zhu people">Zhu</span>heard a hospital nurse hurling
                “ridiculous”
                personal insults at him, his immediate reaction was to “endure it.” In front of a pregnant patient, the
                nurse ridiculed him and his fellow postgraduate trainees, saying, “You’re just a bunch of country
                bumpkins, complete amateurs who know nothing.” Even though Zhu knew the nurse lacked the qualifications
                to make such remarks, he and other trainees never argued back. “I had no choice; I needed to graduate.
                If I resisted and couldn’t graduate because of it, wouldn’t these three years be wasted?”
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>For trainees, the cost of leaving the program is enormous.</span>
                <br>
                <br> The year the residency system was fully launched also marked the introduction of the “dual-track
                integration” model, which essentially combines postgraduate studies and residency training. While this
                approach saves three years in the long term, it comes with a major trade-off: SMR trainees who fail to
                obtain their residency certificate cannot graduate with a master’s degree or practice medicine.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>In China, becoming a certified doctor requires at least eight years of education and training, starting
                from undergraduate studies.

            <p>
                <span>Once a medical student leaves a residency program, not only can they no longer become a certified
                    doctor, but the years they’ve spent studying medicine become a waste of time—an effort in vain.
                    Beyond that, students who withdraw from residency must also return all wages and government
                    subsidies they received during the program and are barred from re-entering residency for the next
                    three years.</span>
                <br>
                <br>The medical field is vastly different from other professions. To <span class="people-Zhu people">Zhu
                    Jingping</span>, leaving a residency program is nearly synonymous with switching careers. “It’s like
                I have no survival skills in society,” he said. “I’d have to depend on my parents again. To put it
                bluntly, how is that any different from just letting me die?”
                <br>
                <br>For <span class="people-Li people">Li Guang</span>, now a practicing oncologist, this sentiment also
                resonates deeply. Reflecting on his grueling 15-year journey in medicine, he remarked, “The entire
                medical profession is built on discipline.”
                <span>The system actively filters people, leaving behind those who have been shaped into professionals
                    with qualities such as precision, attentiveness, and caution. However, compliance and endurance also
                    take root in these individuals, growing stronger under the system’s demands, making resistance
                    nearly impossible. </span> “These traits are essential for doctors, but this system exploits them,
                which I find deeply unsettling and revolting,” Li said.

                In the long and arduous journey of medical training, the role of a “resident trainee” has become one of
                the most complex and ambiguous identities.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The word “trainee” (规培生) in Chinese contains the character “生,” which can mean both “student” and
                    “doctor.” </span> This duality and ambiguity in its literal meaning also reflect the reality of the
                trainee’s role: “When it comes to salary, they say you’re here to learn; when it comes to workload, they
                say you’re here to work. Essentially, you do the most work for the least pay,” said <span
                    class="people-Bing people">Bingbing</span>
                <br>
                <br> In 2020, the medical platform DXY conducted a survey of 3,023 doctors who had undergone residency
                training. The results showed that trainees in the social residency program earned the highest income,
                with an average monthly salary exceeding 3,000 yuan. Those in the sponsored residency program ranked
                second, earning an average monthly stipend between 2,000 and 2,999 yuan.
                <span>Specialized master’s residency trainees earned the least, with average monthly stipends below
                    1,000 yuan—and 20% of them received no income at all.</span>

                <span class="people-Liu people">Liu
                    Jin,</span> a renowned clinical anesthesiology expert and one of the initiators of China’s residency
                training system, explained in an interview that specialized master’s trainees are full-time
                postgraduate students throughout their training. During the 33 months of residency, they are not
                eligible for financial subsidies from the government or hospitals. “Government subsidies are
                allocated based on the number of trainees registered under the residency system governed by the
                National Health Commission (NHC), at 30,000 yuan per person per year. Since specialized master’s
                trainees belong to the Ministry of Education’s system and not the NHC’s residency system, they do
                not receive this funding,” Liu said.

                <br>
                <span>Despite earning far less than full-fledged doctors, resident trainees endure extraordinary
                    workloads.</span>
                <br>
                <br> Since beginning his residency, <span class="people-Zhu people">Zhu Jingping
                </span>has not returned to his hometown in Hunan to celebrate Chinese New Year in three years. “Two
                New Year’s Eves, I was on duty. The other time, I was on shift on the first day of the new year,” he
                said. Zhu attends to more than 100 patients daily, sometimes as few as 70 on a less busy day. During
                his shifts, he often works continuously for 48 hours.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="quote">“It’s especially exhausting during rotations in obstetrics,”</span><span
                    class="people-Zhu people"> Zhu </span>said.<span class="quote">“There’s often no rest throughout
                    the night. Because there’s always the risk of maternal or fetal death, even when you’re utterly
                    exhausted, you must stay alert. You never know what kind of patient will come in next—sudden
                    amniotic fluid rupture, an imminent miscarriage requiring emergency intervention, or worse,
                    massive hemorrhaging or intrauterine fetal death. Sometimes, these situations happen
                    simultaneously.”</span>
                <br>
                <br> Survey results show that more than half of the resident trainees reported working over 8 hours
                daily on average. Furthermore, 94.6% of them slept fewer than 8 hours per day, and 5.4% stated they
                got less than 4 hours of sleep each day.
                <br>
                <br> According to World Health Organization data, each doctor in China serves approximately 419
                people.
                <span>This shortage of medical personnel is a persistent reality in many Chinese hospitals.</span>

                year, Zhu receives a government subsidy of 6,000 yuan, distributed over 10 months. Along with some
                modest “hardship allowances” for night shifts, he takes home about 1,000 yuan a month. “Every month, I

                <br> What frustrates

                <span>Specialized master’s residents do not have independent employee IDs in the hospital system, are
                    not considered formal staff, and are ineligible for departmental performance-based bonuses.
                    Additionally, they cannot log overtime hours into the hospital’s system, making them ineligible for
                    overtime pay or compensatory leave. </span>“We do more work than the hospital’s full-time doctors,
                so
                why are we paid the least?” Zhu feels this is deeply unfair but also resigned to the situation. “They
                just see resident trainees as disposable, as tools for getting work done.”

                program, despite many advising her that “residency opportunities are hard to come by; just endure it,
                and it’ll be over soon.”
                <br>
                <br> During her residency,
                <span class="people-Bing people"> Bingbing's
                </span>day began at 8:00 a.m. She would take over from the night-shift colleagues, then start her
                clinical duties and rounds. She would examine half the patients herself, while the remaining ones were
                seen during professor-led rounds. Her official afternoon shift started at 2:30 p.m., during which she
                admitted new patients, ordered tests, wrote prescriptions, and double-checked everything to ensure no
                further tests were required. Theoretically, she could leave work once all this was done. However,
                interruptions were inevitable. “Nurses would come to find you, patients would seek you out, and your
                superiors would assign more tasks. It’s impossible to focus entirely on one thing while working,” she
                said.

                <br> A study published in Nature explored potential factors contributing to depression among medical
                trainees. It found that
                <span> “long working hours” and “insufficient sleep” were significant factors in both China and the U.S.
                    However, two additional factors—“age” and “fear of workplace violence”—stood out as unique
                    contributors for Chinese medical trainees.</span>

                <span class="people-Bing people">Bingbing </span> recalled her initial experience at the residency

                answer—it’s ridicule and personal attacks.” She had completed her undergraduate studies at a mid-tier
                university and was working at a prestigious hospital for the first time during her residency. It shook
                her confidence. “I thought this was just how top-tier professionals behaved,” she said. Later, with the
                help of supportive mentors and colleagues, she discovered that this particular department was notorious
                for complaints from both trainees and visiting doctors.

                </span>. Among Chinese medical students, the prevalence rates of these behaviors were 13%, 4%, and 3%,
                respectively.Compared to doctors globally, Chinese medical students reported a lower prevalence of
                suicidal ideation but a higher prevalence of suicide attempts. This suggests that Chinese medical
                students are more likely to act on suicidal thoughts and turn them into concrete actions.

                <span class="people-Li people">Li Guang, </span>who has undergone two separate residency programs over
                the span of five years, embodies this sentiment. His first residency, completed in 2014, occurred before
                the residency system was fully implemented. “Back then, we followed the same requirements, but we didn’t
                receive a residency certificate,” he explained. After completing his PhD, he transitioned from surgery
                to radiation therapy and embarked on a second, full three-year residency. With six years of residency
                experience, Li realized that
                <span> trainees at the margins of the system’s hierarchy “have no leverage to negotiate
                    anything.”</span> Even equal dialogue is nearly impossible, let alone contesting authority. From
                this perspective, suicide may be seen as one way for trainees to escape their confinement.
                <br>
                <br> Currently,
                <span>the Chinese Medical Doctor Association oversees residency programs primarily through top-down
                    inspections.</span> The National Health Commission (NHC) entrusts the association to conduct random
                evaluations of training bases across the country, focusing on base management, training quality, and
                welfare protections. However, when faced with unfair treatment, trainees have little recourse other than
                to report the issue and wait for higher authorities to address it. Protecting one’s own rights in such a
                system is a significant challenge.
                <br>
                <br> Ultimately,
                <span class="people-Bing people">Bingbing </span>chose to temporarily exit the system. She decided to
                retake the postgraduate entrance exam in pursuit of her dream of becoming a university lecturer. “In my
                field, a bachelor’s degree is just the starting point. To have any room for growth, you must pursue a
                master’s or a doctorate,” she said. She thought,
                <span> the difficult journey of medical students is par for the course.</span>

                Thus, <span>the goal of establishing a residency training system in China was to ensure that more
                    ordinary citizens could encounter “reliable” doctors.</span>。
                <br>
                <br> A decade later, Yu Jingjin, Executive Vice President and Secretary-General of the Chinese Medical
                Doctor Association, stated in an interview with Sanlian Lifeweek magazine that the
                <span>residency training system has played a significant role in homogenizing the quality of healthcare
                    across the country</span>. According to statistics from the Health Bureau of Fenggang County, Zunyi
                City, Guizhou Province, after the first batch of general practitioners trained under the “5+3” program
                started working, the number of inpatients at township hospitals doubled, outpatient visits nearly
                doubled, and staff performance income increased as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="people-Liu people">Liu
                    Jin</span> once used an analogy to explain the necessity of residency training: “The training base
                is like a shooting range; resident doctors are like bullets. A rigorous training system is the gun, and
                the hospital leaders, department heads, and base instructors are the shooters—they decide where the
                bullets are aimed.”
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Change is happening.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                In September 2020, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guidelines for Accelerating
                Innovation and Development in Medical Education, reiterating the importance of improving the residency
                training system. It proposed that training bases consider factors such as economic development, price
                changes, and local urban employees’ average wages to formulate compensation standards for trainees.
                Following this directive,
                <span>many local governments increased financial support for residency trainees</span>.
                Data from the platform GupeiBao shows that the average annual salary for social residents and sponsored
                residents in China is 83,300 yuan, which is often higher than the local average wage.

                However, as a significant part of the residency training system, the salaries of specialized master’s
                residents remain largely undisclosed. Residency training bases need not only to significantly improve
                the treatment of trainees but also to make the salary structures for all trainees more open,
                transparent, and accessible.
                <br>
                <br> In August 2022, Peking University People’s Hospital became the first institution in China to
                implement a “equal pay for equal work” policy,
                <span> offering the same pay for residents and full-time doctors. This marked the first case of such
                    parity nationwide</span>. In the same month, the hospital released its annual recruitment brochure,
                stating that in addition to base pay and bonuses, residency doctors could share in departmental
                performance rewards, “bringing the total to the same level as that of attending physicians in the
                department for the same year.” <br>
                <br> Beyond compensation, the question remains: how can the residency system ensure that trainees truly
                learn something new?
                <br>
                <br>
                A teaching supervisor from a well-known tertiary hospital in a southern provincial capital admitted in
                an interview with Sanlian Lifeweek that a training system genuinely centered on education is challenging
                to implement. “We often talk about ‘medicine, teaching, and research,’ with medical work coming first
                and teaching second. But in reality, most hospitals prioritize ‘research, medicine, and teaching.’ Why?
                Because research helps hospitals secure more resources and achieve higher rankings, and medical services
                keep hospitals financially sustainable. But what does teaching bring?”
                <br>
                <br>
                The question of who holds the authority in residency training is a key issue in the system’s top-level
                design, determining its direction and ultimate success or failure. A 2015 State Council document
                explicitly stated the need to “establish administrative measures for industry organizations to take on
                professional qualification evaluation and recognition, and to advance such work through industry
                associations and similar organizations.”
                <br>
                <br> Based on this, some scholars have argued in the article “Challenges and Directions for Residency
                Training in China: Insights from the U.S.” that
                <span>China should reallocate the authority over the residency training system, giving more
                    responsibility to industry associations and other non-governmental organizations</span>.
                “China could consider borrowing from the U.S. model by establishing a non-governmental management and
                organizational body for residency training, jointly formed by organizations like medical societies,
                physician associations, and hospital management associations, with observers from the National Health
                Commission and representatives of residents and the public. Such an institutional setup would minimize
                the inefficiencies and lack of expertise often associated with government-led management while aligning
                with the State Council’s policy directives.”
                <br>
                <br> Faced with the enormity of the “system,” individual capacity and time seem insignificant and
                fleeting. As a result, most medical students adopt the mindset of “just getting through it” early on
                during their three years of residency. But they are all acutely aware that their medical careers have
                not even begun.
                <span>When they cross the critical finish line of residency training and raise their arms in triumph,
                    another shot is fired—marking the start of a new marathon.</span>
